# 552 Project Group 2

This repository contains file created for the CIS 552 Final Project in Fall 2023.

The TableCreation.sql file contains queries that will create all of the tables necessary for
the car dealership system. The queries do not insert data into the tables. The Queries.sql
file contains sample queries for various situations. The data folder contains .csv files of 
every table that is used, including the data that was used in the project. 

To run the SQL queries, import the .csv files into an SQL server. The Queries.sql file can
be run using an SQL console and copying each one or simply by importing the SQL file and 
running it. The TableCreation.sql file does not need to be run, it is included to show the
attributes for the tables, including primary and foreign keys.
